          <h3>How are emergency rooms and hospitals keeping people safe?</h3>
          <div class="auto">&nbsp;</div>
          <p>You may be worried about your chances of catching the&nbsp;<abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;virus in the emergency department or in the hospital if you need to be admitted. Data has found that 80% of adults are concerned about catching the&nbsp;<abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;virus in the emergency room. However, emergency rooms and hospitals are taking precautions to prevent the spread of the&nbsp;<abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;virus and help make sure that visits to the&nbsp;<abbr title="emergency room">ER</abbr>&nbsp;and hospital are as safe as possible.</p>
          <div id="ad-mobile-top-container">&nbsp;</div>
          <p>Emergency rooms and hospitals follow strict guidelines for protecting people during the&nbsp;<abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;pandemic, including:</p>
          <ul>
          <li><strong>Universal masking.</strong>&nbsp;Emergency rooms require that everyone wear a face mask. Health care professionals are required to wear personal protective equipment (PPE).</li>
          <li><strong>Screening at all entrances.</strong>&nbsp;Everyone entering is screened for&nbsp;<abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;signs and symptoms.</li>
          <li><strong>Separate waiting areas for people who have or may have&nbsp;<abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>.</strong>&nbsp;People who may have&nbsp;<abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;may be asked to wait in separate, designated areas of the&nbsp;<abbr title="emergency room">ER</abbr>&nbsp;away from those who don't have&nbsp;<abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;signs and symptoms.</li>
          <li><strong>Frequent cleaning and disinfecting.</strong>&nbsp;<abbr title="emergency room">ER</abbr>&nbsp;waiting areas, rooms, restrooms and surfaces are cleaned and disinfected often to accommodate updated&nbsp;<abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;hospital cleaning protocols.</li>
          <li><strong>Social distancing.</strong>&nbsp;Check-in and waiting areas in emergency rooms and hospitals are arranged for social distancing.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>How can you safely travel to the hospital?</h3>
          <div class="auto">&nbsp;</div>
          <p>If you may have&nbsp;<abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;or another contagious illness, avoid public transportation, taxis, ride-sharing, or rides from a friend or relative. If you don't need immediate medical care and don't have a contagious illness, you may be able to avoid calling an ambulance and instead take a taxi, use a ride-sharing service, or ask a friend or relative for a ride. But if you're not sure if you need an ambulance, call your local emergency number or 911, and they can help you.</p>

          <h3>What can you do to protect yourself in the emergency room at the hospital?</h3>
          <div class="auto">&nbsp;</div>
          <p>Protect yourself from the&nbsp;<abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;virus in the emergency room as you would in any public place:</p>

          <li>Wear a cloth face mask.</li>
          <li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth.</li>
          <li>Keep a social distance of 6 feet (2 meters) from other people.</li>

          </ul>
          <div id="ad-mobile-top-container">&nbsp;</div>
          <h3>What symptoms require emergency attention?</h3>

          <ul>
          <li>Heart attack signs and symptoms, including chest pain or pressure; pain in one or both arms, stomach, back, or jaw; shortness of breath; or nausea or lightheadedness.</li>

          <h3>What COVID-19 symptoms require emergency care?</h3>
          <div class="auto">&nbsp;</div>
          <p>Seek care immediately if you have or may have&nbsp;<abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;and experience any of these emergency signs or symptoms:</p>

If you're traveling to the hospital by an ambulance, tell the medics. This will give the emergency room staff time to prepare and use infection control practices and wear&nbsp;<abbr title="personal protective equipment">PPE</abbr>. The&nbsp;<abbr title="emergency room">ER</abbr>&nbsp;staff may also give you specific instructions to follow when you arrive, such as wearing a cloth face mask and waiting in a separate area of the emergency room.</p>
          <p>In the emergency room, doctors will evaluate your symptoms, and they may perform blood tests and X-rays. They'll determine whether to test you for the&nbsp;<abbr title="coronavirus disease 2019">COVID-19</abbr>&nbsp;virus. If your condition is serious, you may be admitted to the hospital. If admitted, you'll be placed in a single-person room. Medical staff will wear personal protective equipment, including masks and eye protection, when caring for you.</p>
          <h3>Not sure if you need to go the emergency room or hospital?</h3>
          <div class="auto">&nbsp;</div>
          <p>If you're not sure if you should get emergency care, call your doctor or medical team for advice. If it's outside of business hours, you may be able to ask for the on-call doctor. If your hospital or employer has a nurse triage line, call this number to discuss your symptoms. You might be able to have a virtual visit or phone call, go to an urgent care or express care clinic, or delay going to the doctor.</p>
